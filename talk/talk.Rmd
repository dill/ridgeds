# Correlated covariates in distance sampling


## Detection functions

- Models of the form:
    $g(x;\theta,z) = \mathbf{P}(\text{detected}| \text{observed } x, z)$
  - distances $x$
  - estimate parameters $\theta$
  - covariates $z$, that affect detection
- What about correlations in the $z$s?



## What are the covariates we usually collect?

- Terrestrial: foliage cover
- Marine: Beaufort sea state 
- Both: weather, observer, time


## What can go wrong?



## Some ideas from regression

- Ridge regression
- VIF
- PCA/PCO


## Simulation


## Should we always do this?



## Real data



## Conclusions
