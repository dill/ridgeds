Extra notes on ridgeds
======================


*What am I trying to show here?* What is the effect of covariates that are highly correlated with distance on estimate of detectability?

How do we simulate this situation?

What would be happening mathematically? Covarite is a mix of the true covariate and the observed?

What is a realistic model of this issue?

Simulate "visability" or "sighting conditions"-type data.

Some "transects" (doesn't matter, since the detection function doesn't take any notice) with "good" sightability, some with variable sightability. Multinomial w. higher weight on zero?




Becker and Quang (2009) JABES (p. 211) has a description of search distance -- seems like a truncation, maybe generate observations using different truncations?
